# Thrust 2016
-------------

In 1986 Thrust was released on Commodore 64, a few months before it arrived on
 the systems it was originally designed for (BBC and Acorn Electron).  The
 game featured simple 2d vector graphics, a physics engine, limpet guns, and an orb.
 You controlled a ship, and your task on each level was to collect the orb, by
 means of a tractor beam which, when attached to the orb, would complicate the gravitational and thrust
 forces acting on your ship. making escaping the cave style level layouts require
 extraordinary skill and control.  Then fly the orb upwards into space where you 
 hyperspace to the next level.  
 
 The game, for a budget release was well received, and gameplay stands up well
 even today.  I've enjoyed playing the game a lot on emulators of the classic systems, but
 was fustrated with the poor IOS and android clones which can be found in the App store.
 
 So I wrote one myself.
 
 This is the Thrust Platform portal. Here you can play alpha, beta and final builds of the
 game as it is developed, on your PC / Mac or any other HTML5 enabled device 
 Basically anything with a moderately fast CPU and a browser. 
 
 The game itself is open-source javascript.  You can fork the codebase
  and write your own Thrust inspired games, help main platform development, 
  or simply enjoy playing the game through its development cycles.  

 
### Help test for a free licence. 
 (Warning Tech jargon)
 
All iterations of the game are automatically tested using Unit Testing tool Mocha, 
End to end testing frameworks Nightwatch + Phase-2-e and also cloud based
device testing tool Browserstack all via (Travis CI).
This keeps the game as bug free as possible... But read below for
if you see some gameplay bugs, feel free to post a bug report.  
 
If you spot a bug and report it via the Github page => Issues tab
